# Code Editor Shortcuts

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin adds keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) commonly found in code editors such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

### Important notes

- `Ctrl` + `Enter` for 'Insert line below' may conflict with the default shortcut for _Toggle checklist status_; changing/removing one of the bindings is recommended.
- `Ctrl` + `D` for 'Select word or next occurrence of selection' will behave differently depending on how the initial selection was made. If it was also done via `Ctrl` + `D`, the command will only look for the entire word in subsequent matches. However, if the selection was done by hand, it will search within words as well.
- If you are looking for the `Alt` + `Up` and `Alt` + `Down` shortcuts from VS Code, you can assign those hotkeys to Obsidian's built in actions "Move line up" and "Move line down".

### Multiple Cursors

These shortcuts also work with [multiple cursors](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Working+with+multiple+cursors), with the exception of:

- Expand selection to quotes or brackets
- Go to next/previous heading

However, if you're using Live Preview, undo and redo will not work intuitively â€“ actions will be handled individually for each cursor, rather than grouped together. If this becomes an issue for you, you can switch back to the legacy editor in Settings as a workaround as actions will be grouped in that case.

## Installing the plugin

Refer to the official installation instructions for third-party plugins [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Community+plugins).
